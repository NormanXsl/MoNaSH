          <div><p id="des-p">The Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie , is a creature in Scottish folklore that is said to live in the Scottish Highlands. 
            It is often described as large, long-necked, and with one or more humps protruding from the water.
        over the past century, there are rumours from the public that some people have witnessed its existence in Loch Ness. However, the truth of this creature remains uncertain.</p>

                        man when Columba intervened, ordering the beast

                    <p>In 1933 the Loch Ness monster’s legend began 
                      to grow. At the time, a road near Loch Ness 
                      was finished, offering a whole view of the lake.
                    Then a couple saw a “dragon or prehistoric monster” and after 
                  they cross the car path. it disappears.The incident was reported
                   in a Scottish newspaper, and numerous sightings followed. At 
                  the end of the year, along the lake's shore, a game hunter found
                  large footprints that he believed belonged to “a very powerful soft-footed 
                  animal about 20 feet [6 metres] long.” the Loch Ness monster’s legend began to grow.</p>

                    <p>In 1934, an English physician Robert Kenneth Wilson
                       photographed the alleged creature. The popular
                       image—known as the “surgeon’s photograph”—appeared
                        to show the monster’s small head and neck. The Daily
                         Mail printed the photograph, inspiring an international
                          sensation. Many people speculated that the monster was a
                           plesiosaur, a marine reptile that went extinct some 
                           65.5 million years ago which became a huge shock to

                      fishing boat Rival III. Its crew noted a large object 
                      keeping pace with the vessel at a depth of 146 metres 
                      . It was detected for 800 m before 
                      contact was lost and regained. Previous sonar attempts

                      the monster until this day. Shiels claimed to have witnessed 
                      the animal 
                      out of the water. He described it as an "elephant

                      actually the squid's "trunk" and that a white spot at the

                    video of a "mysterious wave" in the loch. According to Elder, 
                    the wave was produced by a 4.5 m "solid black object" just under 
                    the surface of the water.Elder was taking a picture of a swan
                    at the Fort Augustus pier on the south-western end of the loch,
                     when he captured the movement. He said, "The water was very 
                     still at the time and there were no ripples coming off the 
                     wave and no other activity on the water."</p>

                <p>On 19 April 2014, it was reported that a satellite 
                  image on Apple Maps showed what appeared to be a large 
                  creature. it was thought by some to be the Loch Ness Monster 
                  just below the surface of Loch Ness. At the loch's far north, 
                  the image appeared about 30 metres long.</p>
